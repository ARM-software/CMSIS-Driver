# Overview {#mainpage}

The **[CMSIS-Driver specification](http://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/Driver/index.html)** defines a uniform software API for peripheral driver interfaces that can be used by middleware stacks and user applications.

This documentation covers a set of reference CMSIS-Driver implementations for external peripheral devices.

The implementations are maintained in a public **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/arm-software/CMSIS-Driver)**. Their releases in **[CMSIS Pack format](https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org/)** are also available on **[CMSIS Packs page](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/cmsis/cmsis-packs)** under *Arm* - *CMSIS Drivers for external devices* category and can be used in environments supporting the CMSIS-Pack concept.

Interested parties are welcome to contribute their drivers to the referenced repository.
